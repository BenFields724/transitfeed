# transitfeed-ride

Provides a library to help you parse and validate [GTFS-Ride](https://github.com/ODOT-PTS/GTFS-ride) feed files.  

To install either clone the repo using git or download the repo using the download feature.

Make sure that python is installed on your machine before running the feedvalidator. This tool was developed and tested with python 2.7. Other versions may not work.

To run the feedvalidator.py script navigate to the directory that contains the feedvalidator.py script and enter the following command:
python feedvalidator_ride.py location/of/feed/to/be/validated

The validator will then generate an html report with a summary of the feed.
