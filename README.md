# transitfeed-ride

Provides a library to help you parse and validate [GTFS-ride](https://github.com/ODOT-PTS/GTFS-ride) feed files. 
The validator generates an html report with a summary of the feed. 

## Macosx and Windows
To install, either clone the repo using git or download the repo using the download feature.

Make sure that python is installed on your machine before running the feedvalidator. This tool was developed and tested with python 2.7. Other versions may not work.

To run the feedvalidator.py script open up the terminal and navigate to the directory that contains the feedvalidator.py script. Once there enter the following command:
python feedvalidator_ride.py location/of/feed/to/be/validated

## Windows
To install, locate the feedvalidator_ride.exe file in this repo, select it, then download.
Running the application is as simple as double clicking on the executable once downloaded.

If you have the folder already, you can drag the folder onto the executable to validate the feed. You can also enter the location of your feed file once the validation program has begun
